/**
 * dispatch_external_command() - run a pipeline of commands
 *
 * @pipeline:   A "struct command" pointer representing one or more
 *              commands chained together in a pipeline.  See the
 *              documentation in parser.h for the layout of this data
 *              structure.  It is also recommended that you use the
 *              "parseview" demo program included in this project to
 *              observe the layout of this structure for a variety of
 *              inputs.
 *
 * Note: this function should not return until all commands in the
 * pipeline have completed their execution.
 *
 * Return: The return status of the last command executed in the
 * pipeline.

	/*
	 * Note: this is where you'll start implementing the project.
	 *
	 * It's the only function with a "TODO".  However, if you try
	 * and squeeze your entire external command logic into a
	 * single routine with no helper functions, you'll quickly
	 * find your code becomes sloppy and unmaintainable.
	 *
	 * It's up to *you* to structure your software cleanly.  Write
	 * plenty of helper functions, and even start making yourself
	 * new files if you need.
	 *
	 * For D1: you only need to support running a single command
	 * (not a chain of commands in a pipeline), with no input or
	 * output files (output to stdout only).  In other words, you
	 * may live with the assumption that the "input_file" field in
	 * the pipeline struct you are given is NULL, and that
	 * "output_type" will always be COMMAND_OUTPUT_STDOUT.
	 *
	 * For D2: you'll extend this function to support input and
	 * output files, as well as pipeline functionality.
	 *
	 * Good luck!
